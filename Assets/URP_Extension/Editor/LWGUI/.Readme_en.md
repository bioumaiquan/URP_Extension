### Light Weight ShaderGUI

![image-20200531191112881](.Readme_en.assets/image-20200531191112881.png)

LWGUI is an alternative to general ShaderGUI, written in order to write minimal code and keep it flexible and easy to use. All functions are based on Custom Drawer, you can implement various custom ShaderGUI by adding Attribute before Shader Property. Typesetting when writing Shader, different Shader does not affect each other. **Shader needs to add `CustomEditor "JTRP.ShaderDrawer.LWGUI"` at the end.**

[JTRP](https://github.com/Jason-Ma-233/JasonMaToonRenderPipeline) is a Unity HDRP ToonShading Render Pipeline. LWGUI is built into JTRP. You can find more usage examples in JTRP’s [Lit Shader](https://github.com/Jason-Ma-233/JasonMaToonRenderPipeline/blob/master/Assets/JTRP/Runtime/Material/Lit/MyLitShader.shader).

**Function List**

```c#
/// Create a folding group
/// group：group key，use property name if not provided
/// keyword：'_' = ignore, not filled and "__" = the capitalization of the property name + "_ON"
/// style：0 = off by default; 1 = open by default; 2 = 0 & without toggle; 3 = 1 & without toggle
Main(string group = "", string keyWord = "", float style = 0)

/// Draw the property in the default way in the folding group
/// group：the group key of the parent folding group, support display according to keyword
Sub(string group)

/// n = display name，k = KeyWord，up to 5 pairs
/// the value of the float property is the currently activated KeyWord index（0-4）
KWEnum(string group, string n1, string k1, ... string n5, string k5)

/// Display texture in a single line, support extra propertys
Tex(string group = "", string extraPropName = "")

/// Support up to 4 colors in a single line, support HDR / HSV
/// parameter："HSV" = Convert color to HSV; '_' = ignore
/// color：color property name
/// Note: Changing the parameter needs to throw an error in the shader to refresh the Drawer instance
Color(string group, string parameter, string color2, string color3, string color4)

/// keyword：'_' = ignore, not filled and "__" = the capitalization of the property name + "_ON"
SubToggle(string group, string keyWord = "")
    
/// Same as built-in PowerSlider, non-linear Range
SubPowerSlider(string group, float power = 1)
    
/// Same as the built-in Header, only used together with LWGUI
Title(string group, string header)

/// Draw float to change Render Queue
[Queue]

```

The function name with “Sub” generally supports only displaying under the folding group, and the group parameter of the function name without “Sub” is filled with "_" to display outside the folding group. In addition, Decorator is not compatible with the built-in Drawer, For example, `[Header(string)]` should only be used on properties that do not use Attribute or use built-in Attribute, and `[Title(group, string)]` should be used on Property using LWGUI, otherwise the display may be wrong. 

If you need to implement your own Drawer, you can refer to ShaderDrawer.cs. The SubDrawer class provides functions used in conjunction with MainDrawer. caution:

- Overwrite matchPropType to filter specific property types to draw, return false to draw in the default way
- Overwrite DrawProp to draw properties in a custom way, DrawerUtility.cs provides some tool functions
- The GetPropertyHeight function does not work after using EditorGUILayout.GetControlRect(), generally only GetControlRect()
- EditorGUIUtility.labelWidth = 0 only when MaterialEditor.GetRectAfterLabelWidth will get the desired result
